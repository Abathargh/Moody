Thesis: A study on technological solutions for the analysis and classification of human activities based on M2M communication systems and models

Mist Computing is an architectural paradigm in which some of the operations of an IoT network are moved towards the nodes on its edge, in order to fully utilize their increase in computational power and to analyze the type of advantages under this structure. This work is a study aimed at implementing this type of paradigm in an indoor setting, in order to gather information about the activities related to the environment.
This repository contains an implementation of the logic of a Mist sensor node that acquires audio data. It uses Python 3 and it's written to be used on a Raspberry Pi 3 with an AudioInjector Stereo Sound card, altough you can use it on any other machine that has a way of acquiring audio data.
